## View Endpoints

Endpoint references pass the information needed to access a web service endpoint. This information is essential to access a service in KintoBlock. 

To view endpoint documentation:

2. Click the **View Endpoints** button on top right of the **KintoBlock Manage** page.

3. The **Endpoints Documentation** page consists of two sections:

   a. **Search Endpoints section** - The left pane contains a Search field to query and find relevant endpoint information.
       
   b. **Details section** - The details of the queried endpoints (E.g. URL parameters, Response code, and Response parameters) are displayed in the right pane.
